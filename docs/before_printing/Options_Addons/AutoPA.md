# AutoPA (Auto Polar Alignment)

The AutoPA upgrade is a work-in-progress that allows motorized polar alignment by turning the Azimuth and Altitude using two additional stepper motors. 

The steppers turn the OAT with an **estimated** precision of 4 arcseconds/step for Azimuth, and 1 arcsecond/step for Altitude.

They can be manually controlled in arcminute integers via the calibration menu on the LCD, or via LX200 commands for finer precision.
