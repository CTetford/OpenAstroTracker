# Ring assembly
---------------

<br/><br/>
### 1. DEC motor
<br/><br/>
Parts: 06a, 11, 15 or bought GT2 pulley (needs part 15_low)

3x M3x 12mm screws, 2x M4x 12mm, 2x M4 nuts

<br/><br/>
### 2. Ring assembly
<br/><br/>

Parts: 06b, 06c

4x M3x 12mm screws, M3 nuts

Only tighten these screws hand-tight. Overtightening will deform the ring. Leave the third screw on each side away until step 7.

<br/><br/>
### 3. Camera mount
<br/><br/>



Push the two bearings into the parts “u2” and “u3”.

Attach the 4 “Lholders” with two M3x12 screws each. They will only fit in one way, the slightly shorter ones go on the right side, on the DEC wheel.

Connect the two parts to the 2020 profile with 8 T nuts and 8 M4x12 screws. Let the profile stand out about 5cm towards the backside.

Now put the assembly into the RA ring and secure both sides with the “u4_holder” and a M3x12 screw.

Attach the quick release clamp with a M4 screw and another T nut to the 2020 profile.

### 4. Poles
<br/><br/>

Parts: 2x 05, 2x 05.1

The parts 05 and 05.1 are very similar. The only difference between them is one of the holes that is filled:

Insert the 4 poles on the fitting holes and push them all the way in. If they are loose, take 4 M3 screws and screw them into the holes on the inside.

Screw in the poles with 3 M3 screws on both sides.

The 3rd screw of each side is screwed like this

### 5. Almost there
<br/><br/>

Now put the assembled ring on the base and push the poles in the polemount.

Adjust the bearings so the ring rests on them.

<br/><br/>
### 6. RA motor
<br/><br/>

Part 14, a pulley, motor.

2x M4x12mm, 2x M4 nut

Note that the screws are inserted from different sides, to allow easier adjustment of the belt tension.

Take a timing belt and move it around the ring, fasten it on the top of the ring. Make sure it has a nice tension but don’t overtighten it.

The RA motor mount has a indicator that lines up with the “home” and “1 hour” points on the ring. The home point is the larger one, if it is lines up it means the ring is centered.
